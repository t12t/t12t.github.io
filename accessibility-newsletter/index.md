# t12t Accessibility Newsletter

 The goal is to spread news, articles and tips regarding web accessibility. This will be more than a bunch of links in an email, there will be opinions. Focus will be on digital a11y news from Sweden and Europe since these are the physical locations where this particular newsletter will be crafted. But the scope will be broad and cute animals might be featured.

 If everything goes according to the plan the newsletter will be sent out once or twice a month.
