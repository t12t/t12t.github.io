          <h1>Meetup</h1>
<p>T12t started as a meetup group in 2013. Back then it was all about having meetups but now we have grown into something that could be called a network, although our meetups are still central. The ones taking care of t12t today are Ida Franceen, Hampus Sethfors, Pär Lannerö, and Erik Gustafsson.</p>
<p>Nowadays we are trying to organize four meetups a year. We have meetups in both English and Swedish. We choose language depending on who we work together with, who our speakers are etc. Our meetups are always free of charge!</p>
<p>Find us at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/t12t-Stockholm">meetup.com as t12t - Stockholm.</a></p>
<h2>Next meetup</h2>
<p>We are in the process of planning our next meetup which will take place on the 18th of November 2021. Make sure you <a href="https://www.meetup.com/t12t-Stockholm">join our meetup group</a> to get all the info you need!</p>
<h2>Previous meetup</h2>
<p>Our last meetup was on May 20th, on Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>
