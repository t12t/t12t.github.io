# Newsletter

The goal is to spread news, articles and tips on the subject of digital accessibility. This will be more than a bunch of links in an email, there will be opinions. Focus will be on digital accessibility news but the scope will be broad and cute animals are going to be featured.

If everything goes according to the plan the newsletter will be sent out once a month.
