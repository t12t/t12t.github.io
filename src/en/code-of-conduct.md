# Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events and in our other channels are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## Need Help?

Get in touch with us via [our meetup-page](https://www.meetup.com/t12t-Stockholm) or [our Slack-team](https://t12t.slack.com). You can also reach out to any of the organisers directly at an event or online. They are [Ida Franceen](https://front-end.social/@Kolombiken), [Hampus Sethfors](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethfors/), [Pär Lannerö](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lannero/), [Erik Gustafsson Spagnoli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valross/) and [Marcus Tisäter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-tis%C3%A4ter-7a740480/).

## The Quick Version

Our events are dedicated to providing a great and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any of our events, including talks, workshops, parties, Slack, Github and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from our event and our other channels at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Please ask before taking photos or recording someone and make sure you have permission before posting photos of other participants online. Refrain from flash photography, as people in our audience could be prone to photosensitivity. If the organisers decide to take photos and/or record the event there will be information regarding this both in the invitation and at the event.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please get in touch with us immediately. Organisers will present themselves at the beginning of every event.

Organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of an event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at events, including talks, workshops, parties, Slack, Github and other online channels.
