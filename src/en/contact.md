# Contact

You can get in touch with us via multiple channels. Choose the way that suits you the best!

## Via meetup.com

If you are a member of [our meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/t12t-Stockholm/) you can send us messages.

## Via Slack

Our Slack started as a tool for us to organise our meetups. Nowadays it's open to everyone interested. We hope that Slack can work as a good place to meet and discuss digitally. It's also a place to get in touch with us organisers.
