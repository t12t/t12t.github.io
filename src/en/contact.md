# Contact

You can get in touch with us via multiple channels.

## Via meetup.com

If you are a member of our meetup group you can send us messages.

## Via Slack

Our Slack started as a tool for us to organise our meetups. Nowadays it's open to everyone interested. We hope that Slack can work as a good place to meet and discuss digitally. It's also a place to get in touch with us organisers.

We have a couple of repositories on our Github. You can also find the source of this website there. Issues and pull requests are welcome.
